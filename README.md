# Pheonix
RC Tech Club central API server for applications

## Why?
To provide data to all the applications that we build at RC Tech Club, we need servers. Pheonix will act as a central
source of data for all the applications.

## Runbook

Make sure that you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer.

You will also need to start a postgres docker image and setup tables as needed in order to allow
it to connect to a database.

* Run `docker-compose up` to start up the server.
